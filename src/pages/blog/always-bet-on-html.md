# Always Bet On ~~JavaScript~~ HTML 😎

## Yada Yada Yada...

Like many in the frontend web development community, I find myself writing a _lot_ of JavaScript for just about everything I do these days.  Code, configuration, development tools, you can even use it to write your [CSS](https://blog.bitsrc.io/9-css-in-js-libraries-you-should-know-in-2018-25afb4025b9b) and [HTML](https://css-tricks.com/why-javascript-is-eating-html/).  It's starting to feel like it is the defacto entry point to writing almost anything for the web.  Now, I have nothing against those techniques per se, I think creativity, expirementation, and ingenuity, especially in open source, is something that should be appreciated and encouraged more.  Personally, I love writing JavaScript and it has been fundamental to the work I've done throughout my career; from developing on Set Top Boxes and TVs, to seeing the meteoric rise of NodeJS, to the JavaScript renassiance and catapult of excitement in seeing ES2015 / ES6 land, to creating sites and apps using some of the biggest and most popular frameworks and libraries to register downloads on npm.

I recently found out however, that even with my own best intentions, I could lead myself astray.  But as it turned out, I think it was all for the best, as through it I gained a greater sense of connection with what I loved about the early days of web design and how I could still benefit from the experience and wisdom gained from participating in the journey of web development over all these years.  

For me, it all adds up to a new appreciation for the tools I use and build, and how even just taking a step back to zoom out and take a look at what's in front of you can be quite releaving.  I'm sure this is sentiment shared by many these days, especially given the rise and prevalance of so many tools and choices now, and how easy it can be to get lost in an ocean of choices and even forget or get distracted from the real problem you were trying to solve in the first place.

## When You Have a Hammer

Around the middle of 2020, I was in a position where some of the technical decisions on [a project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MwDkszKvq81QgIYa8utJgyUgSpLZQx9eKCWjIikvfHU) I had been working on were starting to catch up with me.  Initially I had opted to build on top of another tool that I had used a lot throughout my career and while it had certainly allowed for a great amount of speed and momentum in the early stages of this project, I realized in trying to coerce this tool to bend in the wrong direction for another problem I was having, that I was going about things the wrong way.  This realization not only helped snap me out of this bubble I had inadvertantly found myself in, but I realized more fundamentally that I needed to step back and reassess some assumptions around web development in general and if I was really understanding the nature of my project correctly in the first place.

As I zoomed out not only from my project, I went a bit further and took a look around at what others were doing in the space and I was seeing more and more, that there was a rise in tools that were (self labeled or not) _meta frameworks_, which meant that they were stiching together a handful of already well established tools to achieve a new product out of that foundation, and presenting that as a domain specific framework in and of itself.  Typically, these tools were often JavaScript first and most commonly, aligned around a specific frontend framework or library.  Essentially, before you could even get going, even if you didn't need to know anything about the underlying build tools you were using, you would have to learn JavaScript and someone's mental model of the web.  In addition, tools, especially of the meta variety, bring along a lot of dependencies and an additional maintenance cost from the project side.  Not only does that up to size on disk, but also adds avenues for more ways that something could go wrong during daily usage.

Now, I'm not saying that the types of projects can't be succesful or good, many of them are, but it was just an observation and trend that stuck out to me, and it was never my intention to go down that route necessarily.  So in this moment of clarity, realizing the unintetionality of the path I was going down, and for a project that I wanted to mirror so closely the way that I and many others related to the web (e.g. HTML -> CSS -> JS), I saw that I was committing not only developers to these points of friction, but also their end users.  These trends I had grown with throughout my career and took for granted was now made laid more bare than ever before, with a choice much starker than before.  

This approach didn't seem justified enough for me anymore, and like a great band long into their career, with their greatest hits behind them perhaps, I found inspiration in going [back to the basics](https://github.com/thescientist13/nono-poc/blob/master/notes/DOCS.md).


## A Perfect Circle

I realized what I loved about things like [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) was that I was still (_mostly_) writing HTML, or at least thinking in that way. Something about the declariative nature of it all spoke to me but I wanted to see how much more of that I could get from just the web itself.  It was around this time tools like **Modern Web**, **Snowpack**, and **Vite** were picking up steam as well, providing compelling solutions for a variety of "next generation" frontend development experiences like no bundle development and ESM first workflows.  In fact, it was also at this time that I was looking at **Parcel** again and while when it came out I recall it having _HTML_ as an "entry point" for the bundling process, it only "clicked" for me now how something could be so innovative in its simplicity (at least to me), and had flown below my radar this whole time in this world of JavaScript.  HTML!  Of course.  It all made sense to me now and I knew what I needed to do.

I realized I needed to find a way to enable the creation of sites and apps for the web, in an isomorophic way so that there was ever only one authoring context or paradigm to worry about, which effectively amounted to _NO_ DSLs or 3rd party templating langauges, and focusing on Web Components and template literals as the main drivers of cross context (browser / server) development and leveraging shared web technologies like HTTP and the DOM.  Most importantly, staying ever more true to the web and the browser would ensure that any points of friction would be very minimal and completely "supported" by [the great docs over at MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/).  In addition, I knew that making a mission out of delivering usable HTML at all costs, even if JavaScript was disabled, was now front of mind for this project, and would have a strong influence in how I approached other projects going forward.

## Don't Outsource Your Core Competency

But what really invigorated me in all this was two fold.  Although I would shed the conveniences and leg work of the meta-framework foundation, I was also excited to try and meet the web development community with a wider on-ramp of support.  I really started to dive deeper into topics such as [ESM in the browser and NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html), [Declarative Shadow DOM](https://web.dev/declarative-shadow-dom/), [`import` / `export` maps](https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/08/import-map-javascript-wicg/), and [ASTs](https://astexplorer.net/) to power the project based on a greater adherence and appreication for first principals and web standards.  This satisfied not only my desires to grow and expand my own knowledge base and make the project more flexible, but could shape it in such a way that the project could be more accessible to new comers who may only just be starting out with HTML and CSS, yet could also grow to support even the most experienced JavaScript developer's needs.

What I had really wanted to build and failed to conceptualize at the outset, was a bridge between the conventions and convenience of the old, without having to sacrifice the power and elegance of the new.  The more I looked around, the more I found [the web was starting to become much more capable](https://github.com/whatwg) and that [HTML was finding new ways to grow up](https://github.com/webcomponents/community-protocols) to meet the expectations of modern web development for all developers.  With Web Components, you can wire up anything you want in a browser to express custom behavior and functionality, and combined with ESM, the browser can keep doing more of the work for us, allowing us to shed dependencies and overhead along the way without having to sacrifice the developer experience we would come to expect from a modern workflow, like fast local development reloading and optimized production builds. 

From a product development perspective, it felt like the project (and myself) had finally found its true identity and calling.

## Onwards and Upwards

I think the main reason I chose to share this experience is that through all this, I've been greatly inspired by a lot of the work and projects in the JavaScript ecosystem, each with their own unique solutions and audiences and how fantastic it all is to have such a sheer amount of creativity and talent to draw inspiration from.  One thing I think we forget is just how much we all have in common at the end of the day.  However, I think we owe it not only to ourselves as developers to pick the right tools for the job (more on that [coming soon](https://reliablewebsummit.com/speakers/)!), but to be more mindful of the impacts of the work we put out there into the world.  From clients to users to collaborators, as technologists we are trusted to provide pragmatic solutions that are context and environment aware, to make sure that the long term beneficieries of our work extends past what is what most convenient for _us_, but rather what is most appropriate for the user, and work backwards from there.


Choose wisely, keep it simple, and have fun!  ✌️
